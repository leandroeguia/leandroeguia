## üßê About
I'm a fullstack Software Engineer with the mission of build efficient and client-oriented software solutions. I have experience in Java development, mostly web application oriented.

When I'm not working, I love to spend time doing outdoor sports, playing guitar, and indulging my love for seeing new places.
